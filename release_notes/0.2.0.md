# *Remote - Github* 0.2.0 Release

*Remote - Github* is currently in **preview**, thank you all for trying it. 

I recevied a lot of different views, most of them are helpful. Thanks to every user of *Remote - Github*, it would be better with you all.

Here's are what's new in 0.2.0:

## Big Feature

**Enable VS Code Full Feature Set By Providing Mount Point**

VS Code supports **Intellisense**, **Code Navigation**, **File Searching**, etc. Browing code would be much easier with these amazing features, but people find they cannot do this with files loaded by *Remote - Github*. 

It is because *Remote - Github* stores them to memory, namely, virtual file system first, so the vscode could not analyze it, so do other tools like `npm`, `maven`, etc.

*Remote - Github* now gives you a choice to enable all these features by writing loaded files to your local fs. It's really simple, all you need is provide a "mount point" (just an absolute path to store the whole *github* folder):

Once the mount point is provided, all loaded file would be written to a newly created `github` folder under your mount point, and everything works just like before except that vscode features are enabled.

After that, you could find anything in your local github folder, and you can compile it, modify and save it, and run it.
