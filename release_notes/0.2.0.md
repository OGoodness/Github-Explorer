# *Remote - Github* 0.2.0 Release

*Remote - Github* is currently in **preview**, thank you all for trying it. 

I recevied a lot of different views, most of them are helpful. Thanks to every one using *Remote - Github*, it would be better with your feedbacks.

Here's what's new in 0.2.0:

## Big Feature

**Enable VS Code Full Feature Set By Providing Mount Point**

VS Code supports **Intellisense**, **Code Navigation**, **File Searching**, etc. Browing code would be much easier with these amazing features, but people find they cannot do this with files loaded by *Remote - Github*. 

It is because *Remote - Github* stores them in memory, namely, virtual file system first, so the vscode could not analyze it, neither do other tools like `npm`, `maven`, etc.

*Remote - Github* now gives you a choice to enable all these features by writing loaded files to your local fs. It's really simple, all you need is provide a "mount point" (just an absolute path to store the whole *github* folder):

Once the mount point is provided, all loaded file would be written to a newly created `github` folder under your mount point, and everything works just like before except that vscode features are enabled.

After that, you could find anything in your local github folder, and you can compile it, modify and save it, and run it.

## Repository Searching

In 0.1, if you want to open `vscode` repo, you need to input `https://github.com/microsoft/vscode`. To do this, you have to open github and find this repo, paste link to *Remote-Github*.

With *Repository Searching*, all you have to do it provide a single keyword like "vscode", and *Remote-Github* would provide you several searching results for you to pick:

This would not break the old behavior, if you provide full link, everything works like in 0.1.

### Resolved Issues

1. Can not invoke `Remote - Github: Setup Workspace` when in workspace.
2. Wrong link in readme.
3. username and password not trimmed before being encoded.
4. click icon invokes deprecated command/ 

### Known Issues

Some people say they cannot sign in because `Cannot read property 'data' of undefined`. I tried to fix this problem, and I found it's related to vscode proxy. 

I cannot control whether requests are made under proxy or not, it seems it's controlled by vscode. VSCode has the same behavior as Chrome, and both of them would read System settings. 

I cannot fix this problem at this stage, but disable proxy settings of your os would help at most time.

Wish somebody come up and fix this.
